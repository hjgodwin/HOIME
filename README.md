# Here's One I Made Earlier
 <img align="right" src="readmeFiles/hoime.png" width='240' height='180'>**Here's One I Made Earlier** is a collection of psychology experiments for use, reuse and learning.  The focus here for now is sharing studies that can be run online. 

 If you'd like to contribute please do get in touch.


# Software Used

 So far, the experiments available below use the popular and really very awesome [jsPsych](https://www.jspsych.org/). There are some details that are worth bearing in mind for this:

 - To get this working on your own website, you'll need to decide how to save the data. Your options are to either save it to a database, or save it to a file on your server [see more here](https://www.jspsych.org/overview/data/). The examples all show you the data at the end of the experiment, since that's the best thing for testing purposes. 
 - Some stuff, like consent forms with checkboxes and buttons, won't work when testing on your own computer. Browsers lock down certain levels of interactivity, so these things have been removed from the examples.

 I've only started using jsPsych in recent times so if you have any recommendations or spot any issues, please let me know.

# List of Current Experiments

 - **simpleSearchTask** : Visual search task using jsPsych. [work in progress]
 - **simpleMemoryTask**: Visual memory task also using jsPsych. [work in progress]

# What's all this Here's One I Made Earlier nonsense?

It's a reference to a chidlren's TV show called *Blue Peter*. In it, the presenters would put together some amazing art project step by step so you could follow (I never did). Then, when they got to a bit that would be time consuiming, they would show you the basics and then say 'here's one I made earlier' and grab a more complete version to save time.
